# **Result Management System**  

## **Project Description**
The **University Result Management System** is a **Big Data** solution designed to process and analyze student results efficiently. It leverages **Apache Spark** and **Hadoop** for large-scale data processing and visualization, making it an ideal system for educational institutions managing vast student records.  

The system automates result computation by generating synthetic student profiles, assigning subject-wise marks, and providing statistical insights into academic performance. Using distributed computing, it ensures faster processing and improved scalability compared to traditional database management systems.  

This project also integrates **interactive visualizations** using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to help educators analyze trends in student performance, identify top and underperforming students, and make data-driven decisions.

## **Key Features**
âœ… **Synthetic Student Data Generation** â€“ Generates 10,000 student profiles with randomized marks across six subjects.  
âœ… **Big Data Processing** â€“ Uses **Apache Spark** for scalable and efficient computations.  
âœ… **Statistical Analysis** â€“ Computes **mean, min/max, standard deviation, and performance categorization**.  
âœ… **Visualization & Insights** â€“ Generates **interactive charts** (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) for analysis.  
âœ… **Performance Categorization** â€“ Classifies students as **Excellent, Good, or Needs Improvement** based on scores.

## **System Workflow**
1. **Data Generation:** Randomized student records are created with unique IDs and subject-wise marks.  
2. **Data Storage:** The data is stored in a structured format (CSV) and can be processed in a distributed environment.  
3. **Data Processing:** Apache Spark is used to perform aggregations, statistical computations, and filtering.  
4. **Data Analysis:** Extracts performance trends such as **average scores, subject-wise distribution, and high scorers**.  
5. **Visualization & Insights:** Interactive plots display **trends, correlations, and distributions** for better understanding.
